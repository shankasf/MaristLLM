Now, only 4 points separate the two among these voters. Trump previously had a 16-point advantage among men.

"The 2024 Presidential Campaign has been full of unusual twists and turns," says Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. "Harris is wellpositioned to carry the popular vote for president but needs to traverse a narrow pathway to achieve 270 in the Electoral College. Former President Trump's candidacy is being held back by his high negatives among likely voters."
